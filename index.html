                <p>Financial institutions have an obligation to safeguard your personal financial information,
                    but you have an important role to play as well. While even the best procedures can’t prevent all instances of 
                    cybercrime, understanding how customer account takeover incidents and theft of personal financial information 
                    might occur and taking steps to minimize your risk can make a difference.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h2>What’s a Customer Account Takeover?</h2>
                <p class="take">A customer account takeover occurs when criminals steal customer information, such as usernames and passwords,
                   to gain unauthorized access to personal accounts, including online financial accounts. Some attackers use synthetic
                   identities, combining real and fake information to create a new identity. The real information is often stolen and 
                   then used to open a fake account benefiting the fraudster.</p>

        </table>
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <h2>How Do Account Takeovers Happen?</h2>
        <p>Sometimes an account takeover starts with a phishing email that appears to come from a legitimate firm or a financial regulator
           and asks for information these entities would never request through email—such as an account number, password, credit card information
           or Social Security number. Other times, cybercriminals engage in sophisticated social engineering attempts, perhaps calling and 
           pretending to be a representative from your financial institution as a ruse to obtain your personal information or account details.
           Account takeover attempts can also result from data breaches or the sale of stolen customer login credentials on the "dark web."
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Some identity thieves send text messages, emails or freeware infected with malicious software that captures your keystrokes to steal
           your usernames and passwords. And others still rely on the old-fashioned method of "dumpster-diving" to recover your discarded account
           statements or other records that haven't been properly shredded
        <p>
        <br>
        <p>Signs there might be a problem with your account include:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>unfamiliar or unauthorized transactions, money movement or deposits;</li>
            <li>missing funds or securities;</li>
            <li>incorrect or unauthorized updates to account information, such as a change of address, email or phone number;</li>
            <li>unexpected notifications indicating a change to your account that you didn’t request;</li>
            <li>missing account statements, confirmations or other financial documents; or</li>
            <li>unfamiliar accounts or creditors on your credit report.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>If you access your accounts online or through apps, most financial institutions offer optional text and email alerts or device notifications
           whenever a change is made to your account, if a purchase meets certain criteria (such as being made in a different state or over a set amount),
           or for any online transaction.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Be Proactive:</strong> Safeguard Your Accounts
            To protect yourself and deter cybercriminals from accessing your personal financial information, take the following steps to secure your accounts.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content">

        <h3>1: Watch What You Click</h3>
        <p>The best way to protect yourself from a malicious link is to make sure you don't click on any. Even if you feel confident the link in question is valid,
           the only way to be 100 percent sure you’re safe is to not engage. Instead of clicking, responding to a suspicious email, or downloading an attachment from
           an unknown source, go straight to your financial firm's website or use their app to confirm they sent the information. Any interaction with fraudulent 
           communications increases your risk of loading malware onto your device and exposing your personal information
        </p>
        <h3>2: Use Strong Passwords</h3>
        <p>Don’t share your passwords with others or leave them unprotected. Use a different password for each of your accounts, and change your passwords regularly.
           To keep track of and protect your multiple passwords, consider using a password manager—an app that protects online accounts by suggesting and saving individual,
           strong passwords for each account. Password managers are offered by well-known mobile devices and storage providers.
        </p>
        <h3>3: Enable Multifactor Authentication</h3>
        <p>Enabling multifactor authentication (MFA) can significantly reduce the likelihood of a cybercriminal taking over your account. Unlike single-factor authentication
           (e.g., a password), MFA offers added protection by using two or more different types of factors—such as a password and a code sent by text message or a physical 
           identifier or biometric, such as a fingerprint, voice or facial recognition.
        </p>
        <h3>4: Use Your Own Device</h3>
        <p>If possible, avoid using public computers or devices that aren’t yours to access your financial accounts. Public computers might contain software that captures
           passwords and PINs, which others can then access. If you do use another computer, be sure to delete your "Temporary Internet Files," or "Cache," and clear your
           "History" after you log out of your account. And use strong passwords, passphrases or biometrics to protect not only your mobile devices but also any financial 
           apps you use.</p>
        <h3>5: Be Cyber Safe When Using Wi-Fi</h3> 
        <p>Many public hotspots, such as wireless networks in airports, hotels and restaurants, reduce their security settings so it’s easier for individuals to access 
           these networks. However, this also increases the possibility that someone could intercept your information. Some hackers will even create their own public networks
           with familiar-sounding names to lure in unsuspecting internet-seekers. Red flags include slow connections or networks that don't ask for you to agree to their terms
           of service. Wait until you can access a trusted, encrypted network to access your financial accounts. And when using Wi-Fi at home, secure your network with the 
           strongest available encryption and a strong password.</p>
